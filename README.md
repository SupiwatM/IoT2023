Week 5-8 (3 - 28 April 2023)

        - Combine each part work with together
          The system can select an EV charger and command the charger to work. 
     And after that, when there is a load condition over the processing part, 
     it can do load balancing and send a notification message through the line application, 
     finally showing the total energy consumption on the Dashboard.
